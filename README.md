IIIF Manifest Filter (plugin for Omeka)
=======================================

[IIIF manifest filter] is a plugin for [Omeka] that provides the default code to
manage the hook (event) `uv_manifest` of the plugin [UniversalViewer] in order
to modify the IIIF manifest before the use inside Universal Viewer, or anywhere
else since manifests can be displayed with any online iiif viewers.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "IiifManifestFilter".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.


Usage
-----

By default, the module only adds the key `filtered` to the manifest, that does
nothing.

So feel free to fill what you want in the file `views/common/iiif_manifest.php`,
that can be copied in the theme.

Check [IIIF specifications (2.1)] and [IIIF validator].


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [plugin issues] page on GitHub.
